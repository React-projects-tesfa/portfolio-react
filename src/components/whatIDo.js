        I have completed internships with Freewill and Google where I worked on
        projects ranging from web development to machine learning. I am
        passionate about creating user-friendly applications that are both
        functional and aesthetically pleasing.

      <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
        What sets me apart from other developers is my ability to think outside
        the box and come up with creative solutions to difficult problems. I am
        also able to quickly learn new technologies and adapt to changing
        environments.
